    <h1 class="title">Yukon Sourdough Rendezvous</h1>
    <h2>Whitehorse, Yukon</h2>
    <p>There are about 30,000 people in the capital city of Whitehorse, Yukon. Summer is beautiful and hot but only two months long. Spring and fall is one month each and the winter is 8 months and dark and cold. The coldest months are January and February and the weather varies from -15 to -40. To keep people entertained in the small city, there are many events in all seasons. In winter a big event is <em>The Yukon Sourdough Rendezvous.</em> This celebration is every winter February 8 – 24th. This event was created years ago as a way for people to celebrate the ending of winter. The event has a Gold Rush theme which brings in many tourists as Gold rush was a big part of the Yukon's history.<em>The Gold Rush</em> in the Yukon was between 1896 – 1899 and it was a migration of about 100,000 prospectors from all over the world who heard about the high amounts of gold in the Yukon and without knowledge of the terrain, traveled to the Yukon to prospect gold. These prospectors came across many obstibles traveling on foot in the winter and came unprepared for the weather. Regardless, the Yukon was a busy place full of people with gold fever.</p>
